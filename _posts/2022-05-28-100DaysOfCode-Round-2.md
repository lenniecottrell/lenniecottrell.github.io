# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2

After my bootcamp but before my first full-time tech job at [Optimizely](www.optimizely.com), I used the #100DaysOfCode challenge to motivate myself and ensure consistency with my learning. It was incredibly helpful and [I learned a lot](https://lenniecottrell.github.io/Reflections-on-100DaysOfCode/). I've been a support engineer for a little over a year now and I still have my sights set on a developer job, so it's time for another round of #100DaysOfCode. 

Here's what I said about the last round, and my intentions for a second round:

>During this round, I grew my skills with:
>
>  - HTML
>  - CSS
>  - JavaScript
>  - React
>  - NodeJS
>  - Express
>  - PostgreSQL
>  - Framer Motion
>  - Algorithmic thinking
>
>In the next round, I want to grow my skills with and/or learn about:
>
>  - JavaScript
>  - React
>  - Framer Motion and other animation libraries (three.js, anime.js, WebGL)
>  - Data Structures and Algorithms
>  - GraphQL
>  - Game Dev (I want to make a game as a project!)
>  - Python (This will probably have to wait for round 3)

Now that I have some experience in tech, know more about my goals, and know that my time is much more limited with a full time job, I have a different perspective. I'm going to narrow my intentions a bit for this round, here's what I plan to work on:

- Learning DS&A (using [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk))
- Learning how to solve leetcode questions
- Building small React projects with different free APIs
- Building sample CRUD apps

I will have plenty to do with just the list above. Everything else I mentioned at the end of round 1 is still on the list, but now it's on the "learn eventually" list instead of "learn next".

I'll be keeping a daily log in Github (and twitter), you can follow that [here](https://github.com/lenniecottrell/100Days-r2)
